# Introduction {.unnumbered}

Changes in ecosystems generate changes in species that impact interaction dynamics and cause a rearrangement of prey and predator diversity (REFS). More and more studies are interested in the disturbing phenomenon of massive loss of arthropod biodiversity due to the effect of urbanization and the effect of human activities (Bosmans et al., 2018; Newbold et al., 2015). The combination of these two factors transforms the habitat and the nature of the interactions particularly that of predators. These changes are affecting the abundance and diversity of their preys and competitors. They have also created new environmental pressures that lead to physiological and behavioral adaptations. These pressures may differ from one habitat to another depending on their degree of urbanization. Urbanization often leads to a rearrangement of prey diversity either by reducing it or by changing the species in the area (Hallmann et al., 2017; Seibold et al., 2019).

There are several ways to study these behavioral and physiological variations. It has been shown that a change in diet can influence behavior. The diversity of available prey would therefore play a major role in the evolution of the behavior and physiology of the arthropod. It is therefore not only the diversity and abundance but also the quality of the prey. These changes in prey composition modify the biodiversity but also the available nutritional components, fitness, competition and predation behaviors. We understand then the evolutionary importance that a change of prey can have on predator.

Among theses consequences, it has been observed that a change of diet could have an effect on the microbiota. Thus, prey have a direct effect on behavior and physiology and a more indirect effect through their microbial environment. The composition of available prey would both have an indirect effect through the microbial environment of the predators and on their ecology.

But until now, only a few studies have allowed to highlight the importance of host-microbe interactions and the important role that microbial communities can play in the evolution and adaptation of their hosts. Only a few studies have demonstrated the importance of non-pathogenic skin or gut microbes in the behavior of some arthropods, including spiders (Parks et al., 2017). The limited empirical data available have all demonstrated that there is a relative importance of environmental effects (habitat and prey) on the microbiota. These effects have often been part of a microbiological or ecological approach but only few studies combine the aspects to understand the consequences.

However, more and more studies have demonstrated the importance of the microbiota. The microbiome have been shown to contribute to nutrition, protection from parasites and pathogens, modulation of immune responses, and communication. The extent of these roles is not yet clear and awaits further study. In addition to their obvious contribution to food digestion and detoxification (Boone et al., 2013 ;Brune & Ohkuma, 2010 ), microbes can provide essential nutrients (LeBlanc et al., 2013 ), provide defense against pathogens (Kwong & Moran, 2016 ), and even influence host behavior (Sharon et al., 2010). 

Predators are a good system for highlighting the consequences of urbanization but present major difficulties in terms of data collection. Predators are essential vectors of information to better understand the effects of the biodiversity of their habitat. They are opportunists that reflect the state of its ecosystem. In this study, we used the black widow which represents a generalist, sedentary predatory arthropod that uses its web as a predatory tool. This predator can stay in one place for almost a year and feeds exclusively on local prey. It is a facultative generalist but has been shown to benefit from a diversity of prey to provide it with all the nutrients it needs. But a balanced diet of different prey types may be adaptive for spiders. This is because polyphagy provides access to a variety of nutrients not available from a single prey source, which can maximize growth rates and survival of juveniles (Uetz et al. 1992; Toft & Wise 1999). However, a mixed diet may be limited by the availability of certain prey types depending on the habitat. It is considered more of an opportunist, so it lends itself well to variation in its environment. That's why we find them both in desert and urban environments. This spider is therefore ideal for quantifying the consequences of urbanization via the study of its microbiota and its web. They could be a bioindicator informing on the state of the surrounding ecosystems. The composition of the microbial environment of the spider would be an adaptive response to changes in habitat and available prey diversity. 
However, little is known about microbiota of arthropods (Engel & Moran, 2013), one of the most diverse group in the animal (Giribet & Edgecombe, 2012). Also, yet little is known about urbanization effects on microbiomes. Here, we combine laboratory and field experiments to evaluate the impact of urbanization on microbiome community and body condition of predatory insects. In the field, we compared 4 different habitats to measure the impact of urbanization on microbiome diversity. Under laboratory conditions, we study the influence of restricted diet on microbiome diversity.

The first objective of this study is to characterize and compare the microbial communities  (more specifically, bacteria) of L. hesperus and their webs in the vicinity of the city of Tucson, Arizona (U.S.A.) according to their environment: desert/natural versus urban.
We hypothesize that the diversity and structure of the microbial community (bacteria) of L. hesperus and its webs will vary significantly depending on the type of environment. Moreover, it is expected that this bacterial diversity will be higher in the desert environment for specimens and desert environment for the specimens and their webs compared to the urban environment. Indeed, the factor of diet seems to play a central role in the composition of the microbiota (Kennedy et al., 2020) and it is also known that prey diversity would likely be lower in urban environments, due to pesticide use, decreased biodiversity, etc. (Bosmans et al., 2018).

The second objective of this study is to evaluate the effect of restrict diet on the alpha and beta diversity of the gut microbiome of a predatory arthropod. 
The results will serve as a basis for future studies on the relationship between the gut microbiota and its hosts. First, knowing that there is a relationship between diets and gut microbiome structure, spiders that consumed a similar diet should have a homogeneous community. Second, the rate of variation in beta diversity should be explained by diets. Thus, the diet of crickets will demonstrate greater abundance and diversity since they are omnivores and have a high protein and fruit/vegetable diet (Ng, Stat, Bunce, & Simmons, 2018). Thus, the isopod diet group should have a lower variety of microbiome specific to their carrot-based diet. 

The last objective would be to identify if there is a basal microbiome in the L. Herperus species. 
One of the hypothesis would be that The permanent core microbiome should account for 30% of the species-specific microbial flora and thus be observed across groups leading to a stable and predictable microbial community. This should thus be resistant to the influence of diet on the community (Chu, Spencer, Curzi, Zavala, & Seufferheld, 2013 ; Engel & Moran, 2013 ; Reese & Dunn, 2018 ; Ruokolainen , Ikonen, Makkonen, & Hanski, 2016 ; Russell et al., 2009 ; Sanders et al., 2014 ). 
This study will provide a better understanding of the impacts of urbanization on the microbial ecology of L. hesperus in Arizona. It will also help determine how prey encountered by black widows shape the structure of their microbiome. And on the other hand, to improve the understanding of their co-evolutionary relationship.
