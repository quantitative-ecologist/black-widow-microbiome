# Notes for Laura's field collection
With L. hesperus specimens reared in the laboratory at the Université du Québec à Montréal (UQAM), several compartments (cuticles, bristles, feces, etc.) were tested with different protocols from QIAGEN and targeting different genetic materials (eithergenetic material (either DNA or bacterial RNA).
